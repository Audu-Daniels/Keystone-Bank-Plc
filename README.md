# Keystone-Bank-Plc
This is an inventory application built with the React Native Cross-platform Javascript framework! I used The typescript technology which is the superset of Javascript since it is an enterprise application where security is of utmost importance. Judging from the fact that typescript is a statically typed and very secured! Upon launching the application, it displays the flashscreen showing KEYSTONE BANK  and then next uis the dashboard displaying the add button. Upon pressing the add button, the user will be taken to the details of users inventory taken! After taken invontory from the stores user can add up their data upon pressing of the ADD button and the data can be stored in a database implemented with the use of google firestore firebase cloud technology for storage!
